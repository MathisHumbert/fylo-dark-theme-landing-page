# Frontend Mentor - Fylo dark theme landing page

This is a Frontend Mentor HTML and CSS only project.

This is my frist Frontend Mentor project so it's not the best code. I'm still a newbee.

I had a lot of fun and learned a lot during this project !!

I'm quite happy with the result.

My code is definitely not the best and not very optimised, but it's still good.
